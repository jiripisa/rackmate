# Rackmate — project notes for Claude

Your plugins as instruments in the studio.

## Code

- Native macOS app, SwiftUI, macOS 15+. Swift Package Manager plus shell
  scripts; there is no Xcode project, so never add one.
- `Sources/RackmateCore` holds logic without UI (no SwiftUI/AppKit) and is
  covered by `swift test` (Swift Testing). `Sources/Rackmate` is the SwiftUI
  app and stays a thin layer over the core. New logic goes into the core,
  test first.
- Build and run: `./run.sh` (debug, logs in the terminal), `./run.sh release`,
  `./build.sh [debug|release|dist|clean]`. Details in `development_workflow.md`.
- Every user-visible change gets a line under `## Unreleased` in
  `CHANGELOG.md`; the release notes and the update dialog come from it.

## Rules that are easy to break

- Every Audio Unit lifecycle call (instantiate, initialize, restore,
  uninitialize, dispose, factory preset select) runs on the main thread. JUCE
  plugins crash otherwise. A `HostedPlugin` released elsewhere hands its
  disposal to the main thread.
- Never compare plugin state with stored state: plugins regenerate per-instance
  data (ids, names, time stamps). A change means the state read when the window
  opened differs from the state read when it closes, in the same instance.
- Units go before the engine, and the router before the engine.
- The render thread never allocates, locks, logs or calls Swift.
- A nil `audioDeviceUID` follows the default device and never writes its sample
  rate or buffer size. Only a device picked in Settings is written.
- Checks with audio running use silent units only. No test unit that makes a
  test signal may reach the app, and no standalone effect with a live input.
- Hardware tests with real plugins need the owner's OK.
- `com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory` stays in
  `Resources/Rackmate.entitlements`. Without it macOS kills Rackmate when a
  PACE/iLok protected plugin loads, and no test catches that.

## Releases

- Use the project skill `release` (`.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md`) for
  every release; it holds the whole procedure and its checks.
- Signing: Developer ID Application certificate and the `notary`
  notarytool profile live in the login Keychain.
- The Sparkle EdDSA private key lives only in the login Keychain. Never put
  it (or an exported copy) into the repo; `Info.plist` holds only the public
  key (`SUPublicEDKey`).

## Website (`docs/`, GitHub Pages)

- Served from `main` / `docs` at https://jiripisa.github.io/rackmate/. The download links and
  version strings on the pages are bumped with every release.
- `docs/manual.html` describes every control of the app. A user-visible
  change is not done until the manual says how to use it; screenshots live
  in `docs/assets/manual/`, and `docs/assets/rackmate-window.png` on the home
  page is a copy of `manual/mixer.png`.
- The site has no dark mode: the home page opens on a dark band with the white
  logo, and everything else is a light page, which the black logo needs.
- **The site is bilingual.** Every change to `docs/index.html` or
  `docs/manual.html` must also go into `docs/cs/` (and the other way
  round). Shared styles live in `docs/assets/`.
- Pages serves everything under `docs/`, so `docs/superpowers/` and
  `docs/studio-session.md` are public too.
